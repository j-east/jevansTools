                         TERMS AND CONDITIONS

0. Definitions.

"This License" refers to Server Side Public License Version 1.

"Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works, such as semiconductor masks.

"The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License.

"You" means the individual or legal entity exercising permissions granted
by this License and/or using the Program for any purpose.

"Source Code" means the preferred form of a work for making modifications
to it.

"Executable" means any form of the Program other than Source Code.

"External Deployment" means the use of the Program to provide a service,
or to operate software or hardware to provide a service, for users other
than You, including, but not limited to, offering a service the value of
which entirely or primarily derives from the value of the Program, making
the functionality of the Program available to users in any manner that is
substantially the same as offering a service the value of which entirely
or primarily derives from the value of the Program, or using the Program
to create a service that is substantially the same as the Program.

1. License Grant.

Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby
grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free,
irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Program
and such Derivative Works in Source Code or Executable form.

2. Grant of Patent License.

Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby
grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free,
irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have
made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Program,
where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such
Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone
or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Program to which such
Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against
any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging
that the Program or a Contribution incorporated within the Program
constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent
licenses granted to You under this License for that Program shall terminate
as of the date such litigation is filed.

3. Conditions.

3.1. If You distribute the Program or a modified version of the Program,
You must make the Source Code for the Program or the modified version of
the Program available under this License.

3.2. If You make the functionality of the Program or a modified version
available to third parties as a service (in any manner including without
limitation by offering a service the value of which entirely or primarily
derives from the value of the Program, making the functionality of the
Program available, or using the Program to create a service), You must
make the Service Source Code available via the same distribution mechanism
as You make the Program or modified version available under Section 3.1.

"Service Source Code" means the Corresponding Source for the Program or
the modified version, and the Corresponding Source for all programs that
you use to make the Program or modified version available as a service,
including, without limitation, management software, user interfaces,
application program interfaces, automation software, monitoring software,
backup software, storage software and hosting software, all such that a
user could run an instance of the service using the Service Source Code
you make available.

4. Termination.

The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You
fail to comply with the terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30
days of becoming aware of the breach. Provisions which, by their nature,
must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.

5. Disclaimer of Warranty.

Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides
the Program on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY
KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any
warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining
the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Program and assume any
risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

6. Limitation of Liability.

In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence),
contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate
and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental,
or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License
or out of the use or inability to use the Program (including but not limited
to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or
malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such
Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

7. General.

If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision
shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. Any
law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be
construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe this License
against a Contributor.
